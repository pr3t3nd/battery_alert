# Low Battery Alert APP
My computer's battery alert thingy is broken and im learning python so i actually made a low battery alert app thingy and ima put it here in case someone ever needs it. Got help from AI aswell.

It uses psutil,tkinter,pystray and pillow and is bundled up with pyinstaller 

## How it works:
It constantly get's the values of charging yes or no, how much % the pc currently has and if it's under threshold which i have at 20% it will warn you and if it goes at 10% it will warn you again.
